You asked for more, and I was happy to oblige, because this blog only scratches the surface. On [Twitter][twitter], and in the discussion sections here, I mentioned that a longer-form version of my YDNjQ series was in progress. Back in early 2015, I began writing [a new book titled "Beyond jQuery"][leanpub]. My goal was to greatly expand on the topics I wrote about in this blog. Well, it is finally finished, and it contains _much_ more detail, _much_ more code, and I cover _many_ more topics! It's 13 chapters, about 300 pages, and contains an accompanying [full-stack code repository][exercise] that touches on much of the material discussed in the book. You can pre-order a [copy of the book on Amazon][amazon], with an expected publication date of November, 2016. Please contact me on [Twitter][twitter] if you have any comments, questions, or requests.
