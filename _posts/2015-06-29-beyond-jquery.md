title: ...and Much, Much More!
---

You asked for more, and I was happy to oblige, because this blog only scratches the surface. On [Twitter][twitter], and in the discussion sections here, I mentioned that a longer-form version of my YDNjQ series was in progress. Back in early 2015, I began writing [a new book titled "Beyond jQuery"][beyond-jquery]. My book aims to greatly expand on the topics I have written about in this blog. There will be _much_ more detail, _much_ more code, and I will cover _many_ more topics. Expect the book to be about 15 chapters and _at least_ 300 pages. As of June 2016, the book is almost 80% complete with 11 finished chapters and 250 pages.

Carrying on the tradition of this blog, Beyond jQuery will follow a [lean publishing process][lean-publishing]. In short, I will be publishing new chapters as I complete them and will take reader feedback into account when considering adjustments to existing chapters as well as planned chapters.

You can [download a **free preview** of the book][beyond-jquery-preview] _before_ you purchase. If you  This extended preview is 36 pages long and will demonstrate the tone and format of the entire book. It includes the following chapters:

- Preface
- Introduction
- Chapter 1: The Oppressive Magic of jQuery
- Chapter 2: You Don't Need jQuery (anymore)

After you've enjoyed the free preview, please do purchase a [full copy][beyond-jquery]. Once you've purchased a copy of the complete book, you will have access to _all_ future updates, including new chapters as soon as they are published. So go get a copy of Beyond jQuery now while it's still in progress! As a purchaser you will have the ability to influence the book _as it is being written_!
