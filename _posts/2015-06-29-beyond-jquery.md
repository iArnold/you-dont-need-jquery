title: Beyond jQuery

You asked for more, and I was happy to oblige, because this blog only scratches the surface. On [Twitter][twitter], and in the discussion sections here, I mentioned that a longer-form version of my YDNjQ series was in progress. Back in early 2015, I began writing [a new book titled "Beyond jQuery"][beyond-jquery]. My book aims to greatly expand on the topics I have written about in this blog. There will be _much_ more detail, _much_ more code, and I will cover _many_ more topics. Expect the book to be 13 chapters, _at least_ 300 pages, and a full-stack code repository that touches on much of the material discussed in the book. As of June 2016, the book is almost complete, and is scheduled to be publised by Apress later this year. Please monitor the [book's retired Leanpub site][leanpub] for publishing-related updates.
